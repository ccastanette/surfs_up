# surfs_up Analysis
## Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to give a clearer understanding of the weather conditions on Oahu to see if they would be conducive to opening a surf shop & ice cream store. The specific thing we are looking at here is the difference in weather between June and December 2017.

1. The minumum for December was 56F while the minimum in June as 64F.
2. The average temp in December was 71.0F which is 4 degrees lower than in June (74.9F)
3. The maximum temperature in December was 83F, while June had a max of 85F.
4.  The total number of observations on December was 1517 which was 183 fewer than happened in June. This might not have an impact on the results but is worth mentioning.

## Summary

These results indicate that with highs of 83F in December & 85F in June there will most likely be days in every month that are warm enough to attract customers to your business. The lows for these months of 56F(Dec) & 64F(Jun) indicate that there will also always be days that are cool enough to not attract customers. The average temperature of 71F for December and 75F in June indicates that the cool days were less common and you will likely have weather conditions that are good for business. In order to get a better idea of the weather conditions I would want to run these analyses on every month and graph at least the mean, maximum, and minimum to get a better visual of the weather patterns. I would want to pull the same analysis on the precipitation measurements. I think all of that combined would give you a great overview of the weather conditions that would impact your business.
